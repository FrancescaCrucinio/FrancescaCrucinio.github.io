I am a Tenure Track Assistant Professor (RTT) in the [Department of Economics, Social Studies, Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.esomas-en.unito.it/do/home.pl) at the University of Turin. I am also a [Collegio Carlo Alberto affiliate](https://www.carloalberto.org/person/francesca-romana-crucinio/) and a member of the ["de Castro" Statistics Initiative](https://www.carloalberto.org/research/statistics-initiative/).

I am interested in Monte Carlo and interacting particle methods (e.g. importance sampling, sequential Monte Carlo, Markov chain Monte Carlo, McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations) both from a methodological and a theoretical point of view.

Previously, I was a Lecturer in Statistics at King's College London and even before that a postdoc (2023) working with [Nicolas Chopin](https://nchopin.github.io/) at [CREST](https://crest.science/) and with [Gareth Roberts](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/roberts/) and Adam Johansen within the [CoSInES](https://www.cosines.org/) project (2021-2022).
I obtained my PhD in 2021 from the University of Warwick under the supervision of [Adam Johansen](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/johansen) and [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/).
