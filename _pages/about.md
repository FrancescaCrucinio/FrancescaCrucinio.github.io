From February 2024 I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in the Maths Department at King's College London.



I am interested in Monte Carlo and interacting particle methods (e.g. importance sampling, sequential Monte Carlo, Markov chain Monte Carlo, McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations) both from a methodological and a theoretical point of view.


I obtained my PhD in 2021 from the University of Warwick under the supervision of Adam Johansen and [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/).
Before joining King's College, I worked with [Gareth Roberts](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/roberts/) and [Adam Johansen](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/johansen) within the [CoSInES](https://www.cosines.org/) project and with [Nicolas Chopin](https://nchopin.github.io/) at [CREST](https://crest.science/).
