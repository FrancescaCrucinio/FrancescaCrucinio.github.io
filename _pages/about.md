I am a PostDoctoral Fellow at [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en) and a member of [CREST](https://crest.science/) working with [Nicolas Chopin](https://nchopin.github.io/).

I am interested in Monte Carlo and interacting particle methods (e.g. importance sampling, sequential Monte Carlo, Markov chain Monte Carlo, McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations) both from a methodological and a theoretical point of view.


Before joining ENSAE, I was a Research Fellow in the Department of Statistics of the University of Warwick working with [Gareth Roberts](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/roberts/) and [Adam Johansen](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/johansen).
I obtained my PhD in 2021 from the University of Warwick under the supervision of Adam Johansen and [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/).
